Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) detection is an important application of computer vision technology that can assist in ensuring workplace safety. 
PPE is equipment worn to minimize exposure to various hazards, such as physical, chemical, and biological risks that can cause harm to a worker's health and safety. Detecting whether workers are wearing appropriate PPE is crucial in industries where worker safety is a top priority, such as construction, manufacturing, and healthcare.
